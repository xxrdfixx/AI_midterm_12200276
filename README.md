# Predictive Maintenance for Conveyor Belts

## Overview

Through predictive maintenance, this initiative seeks to increase the dependability and operational effectiveness of conveyor systems in industrial environments. In order to forecast possible conveyor belt breakdowns, machine learning techniques, notably Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, are used. Maintenance teams can take proactive steps to limit downtime and save maintenance costs by foreseeing issues in advance.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several key tasks:

1. **Data Simulation**: In this stage, we create fictitious sensor data to model the temporal behavior of temperature, vibration, and belt speed sensors in a conveyor belt system. To illustrate diverse maintenance conditions, scenarios with variable failure probability may be created.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: After generating data, we preprocess it to scale and split it into training and testing sets.

3. **LSTM Model**: We create an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras, defining the model architecture, and compiling it with suitable loss functions and optimizers.

4. **Model Training**: The LSTM model is trained using the preprocessed training data, specifying the number of epochs and batch size.

5. **Real-time Simulation**: This step involves simulating real-time data for conveyor belts. We use the trained LSTM model to make predictions on the real-time data and implement alerting logic when a failure is predicted.

6. **Additional Challenge (Optional)**: We can implement a visualization component to display sensor data and predictions in real time during the simulation.

## Usage

Here's how you can use the code and follow the tasks:

1. Run the code for each task in sequence, starting from Task 1.

2. Modify parameters and settings as needed, such as sequence length, the number of features, or the model architecture.

3. Replace simulated data with actual sensor data and adjust the alerting logic to suit your specific maintenance scenarios.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for optional visualization)
- Any additional libraries as needed for your specific setup

## Results
